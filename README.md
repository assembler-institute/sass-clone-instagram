## What is SASS? What does SASS stand for?

<p align="left">
Stands for "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets." Sass is an extension of cascading style sheets (CSS), the language used to define the layout and formatting of HTML documents. It uses fully-compatible CSS syntax, but provides additional features like CSS variables and nested rules that make CSS more efficient and easier to edit.</p>

## What is a CSS pre-processor?

<p align="left">
A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax. There are many CSS preprocessors to choose from, however most CSS preprocessors will add some features that don't exist in pure CSS, such as mixin, nesting selector, inheritance selector, and so on.</p>

## What does a pre-processor have to do with SASS?

<p align="left">
CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies that make writing CSS fun again.
Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in your website.</p>
 
## Why use SASS?
- It's CSS syntax friendly
- It offers variables for whatever you want
- It uses nested syntax
- It includes mixins
- You can divide and conquer
- It has a large community and is well documented
- If you know SASS, you can customize Bootstrap 4

## SASS has disadvantages? Which are?

- The developer must have enough time to learn new features present in this preprocessor before using it.
- Using Sass may cause losing benefits of browser's built-in element inspector.
- Code has to be compiled.

## Difficult Troubleshooting.

## What is a SASS Variable? Explain why are useful

<p align="left">
Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass uses the $ symbol to make something a variable.</p>
 
## Explain the SASS variables property with an example.
<p align="left">
A variable declaration looks a lot like a property declaration: it‚Äôs written <variable>: <expression>. Unlike a property, which can only be declared in a style rule or at-rule, variables can be declared anywhere you want. To use a variable, just include it in a value.</p>

$base-color: #c6538c;
$border-dark: rgba($base-color, 0.88);
.alert {
border: 1px solid $border-dark;
}

## What is a mixin? Why is it important? Give an example

<p align="left">
The @mixin directive lets you create CSS code that is to be reused throughout the website.</p>

@mixin important-text {
color: red;
font-size: 25px;
font-weight: bold;
border: 1px solid blue;
}
.danger {
@include important-text;
background-color: green;
}

## What is SCSS? Give an example

<p align="left">
SCSS, that stands for "Sassy CSS", is the file format that SASS uses to preprocess the CSS. It uses
the same synthax as CSS but including, of course, all the useful functions from SASS.
</p>

## What is SASS? Give an example

## What is the difference between .scss and .sass syntax.

## In which cases would we use SCSS? And in which cases would we use SASS?

## Explain how traditional CSS and Preprocessed CSS workflows are different.

## Can we create functions with SASS? If it is true, give an example.

## What is nesting? Is it useful? Give an example of nesting

## Difference between @use & @import? Give an example

## How can we import other CSS/SASS files in SASS? Give an example

## Explain the concept of inheritance in SASS.

## Why use @extend? Give an example
